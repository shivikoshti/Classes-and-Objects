# Classes-and-Objects
## Classes
In C++, a class is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a template that describes the structure and behavior of objects that will be instantiated based on it. A class encapsulates data (attributes or properties) and functions (methods) that operate on that data.</br>
## Objects
In C++, an object is an instance of a class. It is created based on the blueprint defined by the class. An object represents a specific instance of the data and behavior described by the class.
### Defining Class and Declaring Objects:
class ClassName<br>
{<br>
Access pacifier:<br>
Data memners;<br>
Member functions()<br>
};<br>

### Declaring Objects:
ClassName ObjectName;
